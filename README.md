# Purpose

- This project was created with the intent of going beyond the basics of Angular and building a fully featured app that uses Firebase API as a backend.
- It is being created by following along with the Angular course on Fireship.io : Which was created by Jeff Delaney
- I will use the information provided in the course to build the app in my own way as much as possible, but I'm sure a lot of the code will be similar
- Finally, I will use the skills I've learned to create v.3.0 of my data logging dashboard, and implement it with Django REST as the backend.
